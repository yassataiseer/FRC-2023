# MDHS VMX-PI CODE 2022-2023
This is the code for the 2022-2023 year at MDHS.


### File Structure:
|Folder| Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| vendordeps | cdn links for libraries required to run the robot |
| grade | Build file configurators do not modify |
| src/main| Primary code for the robot head to the directory(src/main/java) for more explaination of each file |

Any other folders you see will be ignored by git and as a result nothing to worry about as a the compilers generate them.

### Project Setup:

#### Setup of hardware:
Use a windows 7+ computer however code can still be compiled on linux and macos however not ran on the robot itselft.

One usb camera must be plugged into the robot via the rasbperry pi ports. Make sure to remove
the method in ```robot.java``` if you dont want to use that camera module
